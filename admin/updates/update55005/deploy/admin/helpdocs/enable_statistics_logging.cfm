<h3>Enable Statistics Loggin</h3>
Set this to yes if you want the application to keep track of visitor statistics (like browsers, and referals).  Setting this to know will not stop the application from logging
product views and sales.  The statistics will give you an overview of how well your store is performing, but it may slow down your site if you get a lot of traffic.  You can turn it 
off if you don't need it and are using another program to track visitors.
