You can use this photo editor instead of the default basic resizer.  All you need to do in order to enable it is to go to http://foundeo.com/image-effects/ and purchase CF Image Effects. 
Upload it to your /admin/components/photoeditor/actions/ folder.

When you click an image this editor will be used instead.  You can crop images, resize, and add special effects.
