This is something I worked on for a project I was doing, but never fully implemented it into the shopping cart.  It's here if you have a use for it.  It lets someone edit a stylesheet.  It's buggy, but could be fixed up.  I don't link to it in the control panel because it doesn't work (yet).  I intended on having it be able to edit the global.css file in the root, but it wasn't a very important feature to have so I have temporarily abandoned the effort.  If I have time, and i work out all the bugs, I will update this component and include it in the menu.  For now, it's here if you have use for it.
