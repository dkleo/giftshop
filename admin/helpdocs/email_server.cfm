<h3>Email Server</h3><p>This is your outgoing SMTP server (for instance smtp.cfshopkart.com).&nbsp; If this is not correct then orders notifications will not be sent.</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; Some host providers will not allow emails&nbsp; to be sent if the domain for the email address in the From line doesn't match the domain for the outgoing mail server (this prevents spammers from hacking into the mail server).&nbsp; Therefore, if you have specified the correct mail server, but still are not getting email notifications, then set the company email to an email address within the same domain.</p>
