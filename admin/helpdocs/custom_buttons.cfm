<h3>Custom Buttons</h3><p>If you do not have a theme loaded you can change the buttons used in your catalog here.&nbsp; Just choose the button from your computer to upload.&nbsp; The images you are upload are NOT resized automatically so if you created your own buttons you will need to make sure they are to the size you want them to be when someone is viewing your website before you upload them.</p>
