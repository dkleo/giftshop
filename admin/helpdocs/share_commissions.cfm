<h3>Share Commissions</h3><p><font size="2">Whenever someone comes through your store and then makes a purchase at another store within the mall, you earn a referral commission.&nbsp; By default, if an affiliate refers someone into the store, but they end up purchasing an item at a different store inside the mall, the affiliate doesn't earn anything.&nbsp; This option gives you the ability to give them a percentage of the commission you earn as an extra incentive to be your affiliate.&nbsp; Set it to yes, if you want to share your commissions with your affiliates.</font></p>
