<h3>Meta Description</h3><p>Meta tags help to improve your hits through search engines.&nbsp; Often            search engines use meta tags (hidden fields) in websites to index the            site in their database.&nbsp; The description tag should be a brief            description of what you business has to offer.&nbsp; Avoid repeating            words more than twice, and do not repeat the title of your website.&nbsp;            Keep it short and too the point:</p>
