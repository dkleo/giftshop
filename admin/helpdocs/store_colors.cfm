<h3>Store Colors</h3><p>You can use this screen to change your theme and to change the colors of your store. </p>
<p><strong>Important&nbsp; </strong>if you have a theme applied to your site, the theme will override any of your settings you have saved here.&nbsp; So if you change something and it does not change on your website, it is because the theme is overriding your setting.&nbsp; You can remove the theme if you want your settings to work instead.</p>
<p>If you want to back up your settings, you can do so by saving them to a theme using the Create New Theme Box provided.&nbsp; Then if you change the settings, you can simply reload them by selecting your custom theme.</p>
