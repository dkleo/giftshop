<h3>Remove Credit Card Data</h3><p>After you have processed this order, it is recommended you remove the customers credit card data.&nbsp; The data is stored in a high encryption format in your database so it is very difficult for someone to steal the information unless they can manage to login to your stores control panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an added precaution, you should delete payment information once you have processed the order, because you should not need it anymore.</p>
