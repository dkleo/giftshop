<h3>Widget Column</h3><p>There are two widget columns available, one on the left of your website and one on the right side.&nbsp; Depending on what widgets you have turn on and in what positions they are in, determines if a column is visible.&nbsp; If you do not display any widgets on your website then these styles will obviously be ignored.</p>
<p>The widget column styles pertain only to the columns that contain the widgets.&nbsp; You can set a background color for the column and a background color to use for each widget box displayed.&nbsp; You can set this to match the body background or just type a SPACE in the box to make the widget column and/or widget boxes transparent.</p>
