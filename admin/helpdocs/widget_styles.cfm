<h3>Widget Styles</h3><p>The widgets are optional boxes that contain links, categories, and other features built into your website.&nbsp; These can all be hidden so if you don't have any visible, these styles will be ignored.&nbsp; If you have any visible, you can use these settings to match the widget box colors to your website colors.</p>
