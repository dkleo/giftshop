<h3>Website Title</h3>
<p>This will be the title that is displayed in the browser window of a visitor&nbsp;viewing your website.&nbsp; Generally you want to keep this short, but you should include your company name probably your slogan or a very short description.&nbsp; For search engine optimization, the title changes to the product name and brief description when a visitor browses the catalog.</p>
