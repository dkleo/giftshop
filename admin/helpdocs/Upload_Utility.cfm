<h3>Upload Utility</h3><p>The upload utility lets you upload multiple files at once.&nbsp; If you are using the filemanager, you can upload image files, documents, and compressed files.&nbsp; For security purposes, you are not allowed to upload any sript files to your website (.cfm, .php, jsp, .asp, etc.).&nbsp; If you need to upload a file with these extensions you will need to use an FTP utility.&nbsp; To upload your files, click the upload button and select one or more files from your computer.&nbsp; Each file will upload on after another.&nbsp; Do not navigate away from the page or your upload will be cancelled.</p>
