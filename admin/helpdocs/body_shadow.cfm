<h3>Body Shadow</h3><p>You can choose to have a vertifical shadow shown on the right and left side of your website.&nbsp; These are images in the popular .png format that have a transparency applied so you can change the background color and the background image and the shadow will still match.&nbsp; Keep in mind, however, that png images do now display in some older browsers.&nbsp; You can choose the width of the shadow in pixels. </p>
