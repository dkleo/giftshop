<h3>Explanation of Link Types</h3><p>There are two different types of links you can add to the Links Widget.</p>
<p><strong>Site Links </strong>- These are any links to pages or features that are in your website.&nbsp; These links will load within the template of your website.</p>
<p><strong>Offsite or Custom Links</strong> - are any other links that are outside of your website or custom links you provide.&nbsp; These types of links will normally load in a seperate window or tab, or lead the person away from your website.&nbsp; It is NOT recommended that you take customers away from your website, but this is available to you incase you want to provide some external information to your visitors.</p>
