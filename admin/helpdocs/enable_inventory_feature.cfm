<h3>Enable Inventory Feature</h3>
<p>If you enable this feature, inventory will be tracked. You will need to keep up on the units that are in stock and manage your inventory levels.&nbsp; Set this to No if you do not need to keep track of inventory.
You can choose to hide items in your catalog that run out of stock automatically so that you don't oversell an item.  If you cancel an order, items are restocked automatically.
