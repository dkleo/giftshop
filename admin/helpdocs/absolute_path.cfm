<h3>Absolute Path</h3><p>The absolute path to your store is used when generating links to images on your site.&nbsp; The Abosulte path is the URL to your website minus the http://www.yourdomain.com on the front of it.</p>
<p>If you have this installed in the root path of your website then leave this set to '/'</p>
<p>If you have this installed in a subfolder then you will need to specify that in the absolute path.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; If you have the application installed at http://www.yourdomain.com/store/ then the absolute path would be '/store/' (without the quotes).</p>
