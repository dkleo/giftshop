<h3>Show Out of Stock Items</h3>
<p>Set this to Yes if you want to list items that are out of stock when someone is viewing your catalog.&nbsp; There will be a message that appears near the item that says it is out of stock.&nbsp; Depending on if you have back ordering enabled or disabled for each item, the customer may be able to add the item to their shopping cart. To set backordering options for each item, go to your catalog and edit the product. Then choose the Settings tab, and select Yes/No if the item can be back ordered.  You must have inventory enabled for this feature to work.</p>
