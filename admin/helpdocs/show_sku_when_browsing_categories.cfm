<h3>Show SKU when browsing Categories</h3><p>If you want your visitors to see a SKU&nbsp;number when they are viewing your catalog, set this to yes.&nbsp; You might want to do this so that if anyone calls or emails you about an item they can tell you what the SKU number is so that you can look it up quicker.</p>
