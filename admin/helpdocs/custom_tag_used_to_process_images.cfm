<h3>Custom tag Used to process images</h3><p>When you upload images for products and images to your images folder, thumbnails are generated to reduce load times (especially in the catalog).</p>
<p>A variety of custom tags are supported to process images.&nbsp; Prior to Coldfusion Server 8, Coldfusion developers had to rely on custom tags to generate thumbnails.&nbsp; If you are on CFMX 7, or another version of Coldfusion Server, select which custom tag you want to use to process images.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>&nbsp; You will receive errors if you select a tag that is not installed on your server!&nbsp; All custom tags need to be installed by the server administrator using Coldfusion Administrator.&nbsp; If you are on shared hosting and NOT running Coldfusion Server 8, consult your hosting provider to see which tags are installed and supported!</p>
<p><strong>If you are on a Coldfusion 8 Server </strong>select <em>CFImage for Coldfusion 8</em> as your Image Processor (it's a tag built into CF8).</p>
