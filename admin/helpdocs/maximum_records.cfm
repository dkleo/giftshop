<h3>Maximum Records</h3><p>HELP CONTENTS DEPRICATED:&nbsp; FEATURE WAS REMOVED OR MODIFIED</p>
<p>This would be the maximum number of records that will be shown in a category at one time.&nbsp; If the number in the category exceeds this number then the pagination feature will kick in and the rest will be broken up into seperate pages.&nbsp; If you don't want to use the pagination feature in the catalog then set this number very high (like 99).&nbsp; Do not enter a value of zero!</p>
