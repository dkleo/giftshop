<h3>Error Log</h3>
<p>Most errors that occur on your website or in your control panel will get logged here.&nbsp; You can submit an error for review using the button provided when you view the error message.&nbsp; You can only submit an error ONCE.&nbsp; Multiple submissions of the same error will be ignored.&nbsp; If you have purchased support, a trouble support ticket gets automatically submitted along with the error report, which expedites it over and above other error reports submtited from publically licensed users.</p>
