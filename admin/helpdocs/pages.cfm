<h3>Pages</h3><p>You can create as many pages as you want for your site.&nbsp; By default all pages are set to public which means that anyone can see them.&nbsp; If you want to make a page private you must first setup a subscription item.&nbsp; Someone must then order the subscription item to gain access to the page (they will need to login to their account).&nbsp; If you have any subscription items setup they will be listed in the drop down box under &quot;public&quot;.&nbsp; To setup a subscription item, add a product and make it a subscription item (see the settings tab for this option).</p>
