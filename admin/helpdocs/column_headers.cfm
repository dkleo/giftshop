<h3>Column Headers</h3><p>Column headers are the titles that appear at the top of some tables on your website.&nbsp; This changes the styles for the column titles in the shopping cart table when someone views their shopping cart, also when they search your catalog, and when they view a category in list view.</p>
<p>This does not change the settings for the widgets.&nbsp; You will need to edit the widget settings to make them match if you want them to be the same.</p>
