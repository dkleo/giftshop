<h3>Use Captcha</h3><p>If you are running CF&nbsp;Shopkart on a Coldfusion 8 server, you can use CAPTCHA to keep from getting spam messages sent through your contact form.&nbsp; With Captcha on, an image will be displayed showing random characters that a person must type in a text box before sending the message to you.&nbsp; Turning this on will prevent bots from filling in your form and sending you an endless supply of useless spam messages.&nbsp; It is recommended that you turn this on if you are running Coldfusion 8.&nbsp; The contact form automatically checks your server version if you enable this, so it will not show on the form if you are running on CFMX 7 or earlier.</p>
